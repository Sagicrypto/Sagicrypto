About SAGI
Utility token with vision for healthy lifestyle supporting Mories Ecosystem
Mories Organization- an innovative movement for social sensitivity of customer needs

A mission is possible – everyone to have access to clean, natural food with high nutritional values

INTRODUCTION OF THE ORGANIZATION, GOALS, MISSION
Mories is a non-governmental organization created to support certified high-quality food products from all over the Mediterranean. Its goal is to create a culture in customers, to consume products with high nutritional value.

In order to select and offer a food product, the organization has an active quality control mechanism. Each producer is checked individually – what practice of growing raw materials is applied, how they are processed to reach the end user. The team, require a complete chemical analysis of the goods and refer to their useful qualities.

Mories guarantee the right of everyone to have access to good, clean and quality food at an affordable price. They work to introduce consumers to quality goods and distribute them, because this is the main factor in creating good eating habits.

Currently Mories operates active on the food market and food service business in Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, UK, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands, Greece, Romania, Luxemburg, Malta, Croatia, Poland, USA. Our clients are delicatessen shops, hotels, restaurants and selected trade centres and chains. Our products can be find in Harrods, Sainsbury’s, Galleries Lafayette, KaDeWe and selected stores for high nutritional value food products.

Covid 19 & Mories Organization- Challenges & Opportunities
Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused dramatic and unprecedented upheaval to socio-economic norms since first reported. Its impacts upon health systems, governments, and businesses alike with unprecedented implications for companies worldwide. Mories’ clients, partners and members shown concerns of the way how people can reach faster quality food products from the organization as most of the food service market is still suffering economic regress. The unlimited financial support offered from the EU for companies, business entities and agricultural producers seems to be not enough to restart the previously working model with all the restrictions in the law and all safety measures to be taken into consideration in order to be avoid the spread of the disease.

Taking in consideration the advice of the World Health Organization that people must follow healthy food lifestyle in order to preserve their well-being. Mories Organization took action into launching campaigns for offering food products to end customers. Consumers will want to maximise their health in order to boost their immunity and reduce vulnerability to disease and illness. 

Research has found that a total of 76 percent of consumers across the globe say that they are concerned about the coronavirus, whilst 59 percent say that they have become more conscious about their overall health and 57 percent about their immunity. As a result of this, 73 percent of consumers say that they plan to eat and drink healthier.

Mories step forward with strategy plan to face the challenges and offer more opportunities to engage the food producers, to encourage the variety of healthy lines they offer to be strictly focused on the end customer and fulfil his expectation. Mories’ expert team requires completing a good practices of agricultural cultivation and has given a specific regulation to the agricultural producers of how to become approved by it. Complete chemical analysis is required together with monitoring at each stage of cultivation. After completing the whole set of examination process, at final stage the products are being uploaded and offer to the network of Mories.

MORIES NETWORK SYSTEM
Mories Organization has established ecosystem of agricultural producers from which the products are being forward to distributed points (trade centers, hotels, food chains, restaurants) and then they reach the final end customer.

On few occasions only the organization can provide end customer experience, when the products cannot be found in the region, where he is settled, through e-shop on the organization.

Another part of the ecosystem are the chefs of restaurants, which prefer to reach quality products at first hand to offer them to their clients. Mories Highly supports Food and Taste Education and has its own programmes and workshops for children and families to help them get engaged in the process of preparing food.

 This campaigns together combined with experiences marketing team support, gives opportunities for brand recognition of new product lines from the agricultural producers. All the campaigns when executed are being promoted in the social media channels of the organization, which has more than 1 000 000 visitors, followers and users.

The goal of the organization is to create more educational video materials in order to present to the public the bio diversity of the foods and their use in healthy lifestyle, including and focusing in the Mediterranean Diet.

FURUTE GOALS: Creating new digital places for the network to get involved. As the current food expo are unreachable at the moment, Mories find solution on supporting the social events, to create them and support the connections between its members, clients and producers. Our next mission is creating a digital expo via platform and spread the needs of the movement to educate more about healthy lifestyle and Mediterranean Diet.

 

MEDITERRANEAN DIET- HEALTHY APPROACH LIFESTYLE
Mories Organization goals focus on the heart-healthy eating plan, the Mediterranean diet.

The Mediterranean diet blends the basics of healthy eating with the traditional flavours and cooking methods of the Mediterranean.

Why the Mediterranean diet?

Interest in the Mediterranean diet began in the 1960s with the observation that coronary heart disease caused fewer deaths in Mediterranean countries, such as Greece and Italy, than in the U.S. and northern Europe. Subsequent studies found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

The Mediterranean diet is one of the healthy eating plans recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to promote health and prevent chronic disease.

It is also recognized by the World Health Organization as a healthy and sustainable dietary pattern and as an intangible cultural asset by the United National Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.



.

What is the Mediterranean diet?

The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating based on the traditional cuisine of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. While there is no single definition of the Mediterranean diet, it is typically high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nut and seeds, and olive oil.

The main components of Mediterranean diet include:

Daily consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and healthy fats
Weekly intake of fish, poultry, beans and eggs
Moderate portions of dairy products
Limited intake of red meat
Other important elements of the Mediterranean diet are sharing meals with family and friends, enjoying a glass of red wine and being physically active.

Plant based, not meat based

The foundation of the Mediterranean diet is vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans and whole grains. Meals are built around these plant-based foods. Moderate amounts of dairy, poultry and eggs are also central to the Mediterranean Diet, as is seafood. In contrast, red meat is eaten only occasionally.

Healthy fats

Healthy fats are a mainstay of the Mediterranean diet. They’re eaten instead of less healthy fats, such as saturated and trans fats, which contribute to heart disease.

Olive oil is the primary source of added fat in the Mediterranean diet. Olive oil provides monounsaturated fat, which has been found to lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad”) cholesterol levels. Nuts and seeds also contain monounsaturated fat.

Fish are also important in the Mediterranean diet. Fatty fish — such as mackerel, herring, sardines, albacore tuna, salmon and lake trout — are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fat that may reduce inflammation in the body. Omega-3 fatty acids also help decrease triglycerides, reduce blood clotting, and decrease the risk of stroke and heart failure.

What about wine?

The Mediterranean diet typically allows red wine in moderation. Although alcohol has been associated with a reduced risk of heart disease in some studies, it’s by no means risk free. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans caution against beginning to drink or drinking more often on the basis of potential health benefits.

Eating the Mediterranean way

Interested in trying the Mediterranean diet? These tips will help you get started:

Eat more fruits and vegetables. Aim for 7 to 10 servings a day of fruit and vegetables.
Opt for whole grains. Switch to whole-grain bread, cereal and pasta. Experiment with other whole grains, such as bulgur and farro.
Use healthy fats. Try olive oil as a replacement for butter when cooking. Instead of putting butter or margarine on bread, try dipping it in flavored olive oil.
Eat more seafood. Eat fish twice a week. Fresh or water-packed tuna, salmon, trout, mackerel and herring are healthy choices. Grilled fish tastes good and requires little cleanup. Avoid deep-fried fish.
Reduce red meat. Substitute fish, poultry or beans for meat. If you eat meat, make sure it’s lean and keep portions small.
Enjoy some dairy. Eat low-fat Greek or plain yogurt and small amounts of a variety of cheeses.
Spice it up. Herbs and spices boost flavor and lessen the need for salt.
The Mediterranean diet is a delicious and healthy way to eat. Many people who switch to this style of eating say they’ll never eat any other way.

FUTURE GOALS: DEVELOPING THE NETWORK WITH BLOCKCHAIN AND FINTECH
With the invention of the Blockchain – the world received a new technology to transfer, store and exchange data and value. This invention has created a rapid growth of new cryptographic applications and technologies:  blockchains, and distributed ledgers to decentralized transaction platforms, digital identities, digital commerce, secure electronic forecasting systems, and the Internet of Things. We are here to network, support and facilitate the spill over of knowledge to create a sharing open ecosystem within our association.

IMMEDIATE USE: Creating Mories utility tokens as way of in-network transfer of value and data and way to upgrade the services and spread the idea of healthy lifestyle with products, with high nutritional values. The users will have the chance to gain multiple rewards, when using the tokens as in-network payments in the e-shop of the organization and to participate in campaigns for taste education, when they can exchange them for healthy food products from the Mories network ecosystem. Mories tokens on WAVES and BEP 20, will use the secure ecosystem on WAVES and BEP 20 blockchain.

Vision
Mories vision is to introduce the new era of decentralization and transparency to the food industry.

Network participants will be able to receive the complete information about the food product and to track its cultivation and standardization methodology. With QR code applicable to each product, the customer will be able to receive all necessary information, not included in the etiquette and to find healthy tips, advices and cooking recipes, how he/she can use it better in order to preserve all the healthy ingredients in the meal.

Further more solutions

For the business/food service market

Network participants will be incentivized to collect and feed data to Mories’s AI – which in turn will make AI-enhanced diet and care recommendations for crowd-verified food products and food service providers.

Mories will naturally reward quality businesses by allowing their products and services to appear in targeted in-app recommendations and open doors to a vast audience of new potential customers.

For the customer

The market for devices is on the rise and in need of a unified ecosystem for a customer to connect their devices and stay updated on their healthy well-being through a single interface. Mories aims this technology to be given a platform where various users can track their healthy status and encourage them to combine a specific diary plan, according to their health records. They will be able to share their data, and interact via API protocols and send this data to their healthy diet advisers and medical care stuff.

Across many industries, the platform business model has become a crucial building block for waves of technological innovations. The most advanced digital products and services that come to market today are based on platform business models; a model that most business owners have begun to explore and intend to make core to their growth strategies.

 Mories will uses a platform business model – and is the first food technology platform to incorporate AI learning along with a block chain-based incentivization structure.

PAYMENT SYSTEM THROUGH THIRD PARTIES

Customers’ privacy is being exposed in many ways when they are asked to provide personal data to third party services as PayPal, bank gateways and payment gateways. These methods put personal data on exposure, increase the cost of payment for good with significant percent and delay the process of food distribution.

MORIES BLOCKCHAIN WALLET, GATEWAY SYSTEM

Mories Organization aims to increase the transaction time of receiving funds for the products and at less transaction costs using the block chains as transaction method. Providing users to be able to use Mories utility tokens as transaction method for their food products. The solution can be given using secure wallets on blockchain, integration in the e-shop of the organization. Supporting and providing solution to its business clients, a devices POS for payments. . 

When payments made with the utility tokens of Mories Organization, rewards as discounts, personal nutrition plans and participation in workshops will occur.

LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT INGREDIENTS

Most of the food products in the supermarkets, doesn’t have sufficient information about the product cultivation methods, analysis and standardization process. Customers are unable to decide which product has better nutritional value and why. Sometimes need to inform himself/herself in advance.

MORIES ENFORCING QR CODE- TRACK WHAT YOU EAT

Mories Organization will work with tighten connection with the agricultural producer and help him provide all the necessary information with QR code on the product and in the site. Investing in transparency and emphasizing on the high nutritional values of each product, supporting the biodiversity and spreading the healthy lifestyle vision. Including healthy recipes and nutritional tips for the customers with recommended daily consumption.

POOR HEALTH PROVISON

People sometimes can’t tell, when something is wrong, causing a wide range of preventable diseases that often stem from poor diet and lack of exercise that could be easily preventable if users had the right information.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Mories’s wellness-focused AI works to identify the causes of poor health and suggest alternative routes of care and nutrition before the problem becomes out of hand.

CORPORATE GIANTS MONOPOLIZING

Big Fast Food Chains (Mcdonalds, KFC ) and Supermarkets (Lidl, Aldi, Macro) account for 93% of mid-customer food sales in Europe. The massive marketing budget of these corporate giants makes it difficult for trustworthy small businesses to reach their target customers as the marketing channels are flooded by the giants.

CROWD VERIFICATION

Mories will level the playing field for small, health-focused businesses by giving the community the power to prove quality through crowd-verification. Crowd-verified businesses will enjoy an elevated status in the eyes of consumers on the platform.

UNABLITY TO TRAVEL, PRESENTING FOOD PRODUCTS

With the uncertainty of these challenging times we live in Covid 19 situation, more and more agricultural producers feels the need of participating in media events and present their products and brands, new lines of products or just to tell their story to the public, so they can reach more food business suppliers and customers. The need of easy digital communication and presentation made them uncertain for the future of their farms, groves and cultivation.

MORIES DIGITAL EXPO CENTER

Combing the experience of marketing team and with respect to the efforts of our members- agricultural producers, we will proceed to provide them with better way to present their products. Creating a digital expo center for their needs, where producers can arrange meeting, exchange contacts with suppliers and answer the question of the customers. This will provide transparency of how the business works and make easier to provide more promotion opportunities to the products with high nutritional values.
VALUE PROPOSITION
Mories provides value to platform participants in a variety of different ways, using a wide range of tools.

THE PERFECT MATCH

Mories connects responsible users with care about their health, with trusted service and product providers through unbiased in-app product and service suggestions, which reduces the cost of goods sold for the vendor while increasing the value and trust for the consumer.

A TRUSTY COMPANION

The preventative care AI and interconnected with tech devices work together to optimize a user’s diet and daily exercise, preventing the need for unexpected medical visits and reducing the overall cost of healthcare. This is especially useful for professional athletes and active sports lovers.

FOR THE UNDERDOGS

Crowd verification and Digital Expo Center, increases the reach of smaller, high-quality businesses that cannot compete with corporate marketing budgets, disrupting the pet marketing sector. This means a smaller brand can correlate consumption with verified health outcomes and increase their revenue and brand awareness.

WORTH ITS WEIGHT

The Mories Token (MT) Token establishes a currency with tradable value to power the customer’s healthy lifestyle ecosystem and food products with high nutritional value. Mories tokens will be used in exchange for products with high nutritional value, services, and discounts throughout the food industry.

The token may be earned through participation and is usable for transactions being executed within the application. These mechanics make for a smoother onboarding process that shields the end-user from blockchain complexity.

MORIES PRODUCT
Mories aims to offer an all-inclusive platform that emphasizes transparency, traceability, and crowdsourced verification to produce unbiased health-related recommendations for users. The aim in building this platform is to create a system that can seamlessly integrate into the average customer’s life, and simplify informed decision-making.

The platform is enhanced by connected devices, an advanced AI, and a digital currency, which serves as the basis for a micro-economy rich with trusted high nutritional value food products and services.

Mories’s data collection and normalization will create a standard language for the food industry and will serve as the basis for multiple focused API’s and food health-related studies. The data collected on the platform will benefit every player in the food industry.

Crowd Verification

One of Mories’s central themes is putting power in the hands of the consumer. The proprietary crowdsourced verification system does just that.

Through repeated ‘reviews’ sourced from various devices and diagnostic tools connected to the platform, high nutritional food services and products will be proven safe. Once a food service place or product, has been voted by enough users and proven reliable, the business and the product will gain crowd verification and be considered crowd verified.

Local food and food service providers will have a more traditional path to accruing reputation. As results accumulate via crowd-sourced data collection, customers will have unbiased information to back their performance record. Additionally, businesses will gain exposure from positive reviews made by users who transacted with the business through the Mories platform.

This is not a checkmark that verifies membership, but a badge that represents statistically proven quality.

Data Marketplace

Mories will create a first-of-its-kind data marketplace, facilitating the exchange of food data.

Data is a valuable modern-day commodity. With the influx of QR codes users are collecting more detailed data than ever before. Collected in isolation, this data has little value. However, when detailed data is aggregated and given insight with analytics, its value increases exponentially.

Mories will provide researchers, marketers, and manufacturers with an opensource platform to request, purchase, organize, promote and analyze the detailed food data captured across the platform. Users on the platform will decide who their data is shared with and will always retain ownership of the data. This means producers will be able to monetize their own data, bringing balance to the data economy in the food industry.

Product & Service Marketplace

Mories will create a hybrid e-commerce marketplace where producers, vendors and food service providers can freely present their services through the app. All goods and services sold will be in a constant state of quality assurance conducted by users on the platform.

The underlying currency facilitating trade between all parties for both the product and data marketplaces will be Mories Tokens. Mories tokens will smooth out the onboarding process and enable participants to transact instantly, safely, easily, and securely.

KEY COMPONENTS AND SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGIES
BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACTS

Mories will use blockchain technology to empower its users to own and monetize their food product’s data while protecting the privacy and the best interests of all participants on the platform.

TOKEN

Mories’s on line market place platform with its utility token will incentivize users to upload their food products’s data without any adverse impact to the platform’s margins or liabilities.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Mories’s AI will make data-driven health care recommendations by performing a personalized assessment drawing from personal data, existing databases, and community supplied correlations. Unlike a monolithic centralized AI where the user’s data is part of a massive dataset, each user has their own personal AI that serves them while retaining their personal information. The devices (application) will monitor the health condition of the user and will recommend suitable nutrition diary programme, helpful healthy recipes to maintain the balance in the organism.

Blockchain POS Devices

 Blockchain POS Devices will support the work of existing food service marketplaces and help volatility of the Mories Tokens to be easily converted and also will encourage the token usage as method of payment with faster transaction performance and reduced costs to third parties.

5.5 Mories Team

Mories Organization humbly recognizes that scaling to become a successful digital platform and achieve their vision will require additional sets of expertise and personnel. Naturally, successful companies in the digital space do not limit themselves to one strategy. They use a combination of building in-house, acquiring or partnering to make rapid progress, adapting to the situations they face.

Mories has taken a balanced approach to grow a team while building alliances. Mories team possesses a strong, evolving, multi-disciplinary team with breadth of experience in the field of finance, science, legal advice, nutrition, management and marketing.

ARCHITECTURE

Mories Organization is a layered solution to a number of challenges in the food market industry. Core components of Mories’s architecture are the QR code identification system, the generalized document storage system and the data marketplace, as well as creating a digital place for exposure of healthy product food lines and brand recognition. Mories uses a combination of block chain smart contracts, distributed storage and peer-to-peer communications to organize and normalize collected information and facilitate personalized AI and data monetization.

THE BOTTOM LAYER

The tech world faces many challenges regarding how to handle general data protection regulation (GDPR), the “right to be forgotten”, and the possession/retention of data. Mories Organization aims to attack these problems at the source. In our view, most of these challenges are resolved with a new approach to data architecture that doesn’t presume that all data must first be centrally stored and then carefully managed. The Mories approach rests on user custody of their own data and information sharing on a need-to-know basis. Users are given control and insight into sharing proposals, tools to anonymize shared information, and currency in exchange for cooperation.

MORIES SOLUTION

Mories creates the bottom layer of architecture about addressing these concerns with a censorship-resistant, privacy-focused solution. Users must be able to reap the benefits of the system without surrendering data to the system. Mories’s bottom layer is a platform-agnostic, privacy-first, general-purpose data storage layer that uses block chain and distributed storage. This layer provides sovereign ownership of data, suitable for a period of increasing concern about data privacy.

The next challenge is that authentication in all forms is at cross purposes with user privacy. Distinguishing between users is important for practical reasons but this does not imply that the persons behind the IDs necessarily need to be revealed. Similarly, confirming the authenticity of data reports is vital if the data is to be trusted. But, identifying an accountable individual is not the way to do so. Rather, it is one way to do it, and not the best we can do.

Mories reframes data authentication by proving that data was collected by specified methods (e.g. type of device), by producers with certain properties (e.g food products), and gains the food products high nutritional value with certain properties (e.g. chemical analysis, recommended ingredients, healthy ingredients). The Mories proving grammar expresses such requirements. Mories proofs establish those facts without revealing which user or which device.

A third challenge relates to well-known edge cases. With so much data under the users’ control, it’s important that the users themselves are protected from data loss that could result if the files were in their physical possession. And, with everything relying on their digital identities it’s important to have solutions for key recovery and probate. Mories solves for data persistence using reliable distributed storage, and for key recovery in a way that greatly simplifies Blockchain user onboarding and using the system with multiple devices such as a smartphone and a laptop.

The benefit to users is custody of their own information and fine-grained control of information disclosure to others even while they enjoy the features and conveniences of applications. Moriesl’s solution addresses the rising demand for strong data privacy in applications of all kinds.

DATA MARKETPLACE

It is well-known that data is valuable, in the aggregate. Mories proposes that food products data must, therefore, have economic value. Centralized data collection systems generally fail to recognize and account for the value of individual data points. The result is the formation of massive companies built on processes that harvest vast amounts of data, without paying for it fairly, then trading it for considerable value.

There are legitimate reasons to create large datasets with informed consent. Scientific studies and marketing studies need data. Such studies are costly and rely on information provenance. Generally, things that are worth doing have economic value. Mories organizes verifiable data under user control and enables trade. Mories creates a new market of facts.

Mories is a price-discovery marketplace for high-quality and provable information. Users will be offered Mories Tokens to provide specific information. For example, consider a study related to a vegan consumer eating a certain type of food. The buyer would specify qualifying products, the well-being data requested (and qualifying methods of collection), and the bid for qualified responses. The user would take the offer by providing proof-of-purchase of qualifying products, and well-being metrics that meet the criteria for the study. All of this would be anonymous, transparent, and done with the user’s consent.

Phased Build Out

The next step is developing the user experience (UX) that would enable any user to be comfortable using the platform. Once Mories Platform is launched, the development of the UX will begin, likely taking 36-48 months.

By having better on boarding than any other system in operation and knowing our customers better, the Mories platform offering has the potential to become the leader in the healthy food industry.

Mories Platform eventually intends to become a decentralized app store for anything healthy food related. This will encourage others to come and build on top of their layers. The existing architecture will attract other developers because it will quickly help people get to the market.

The first step in the build-out is achieving network effects and a non-trivial user base so Mories platform can attract vendors, developers, and other participants to the network.

Technology Stack

Mories’s technology stack will consist of the blockchain, devices, POS and variety of mobile front end applications.

The platform is to be built out on the blockchain because it is considered to be the most decentralized, established, and successful smart contract platform.

The Mories design team has devoted considerable effort to resolving transaction volume scaling and the user experience. The system is to be  designed to minimize the load on the blockchain network and to minimize the cognitive load on end-users. We will use blockchain to prove, minimalistically, the authenticity of claims exchanged between peers. We use Mories Token to abstract away implementation details such as paying for gas.

The QR code, or Inter Planetary File System, is a protocol and network that delivers a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system.

Similar to a torrent, this system allows users to not only receive but also host content. This system will be built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing.

Users are elevated to the level of full participants in the system they can read all the information available, track the records of all history of the food product, see the nutrition benefits, receive information about its use, recipes, useful healthy tips. The users can obtain further knowledge about the products, with messages to the system and to the producers.

The Digital Expo Center will give the opportunity for the agricultural producers via conference call to be able to present their products and new lines to the public, to upload information about their business, presentation of the products and easy communicate with retailers and distributors in different counties. It will serve the need of immediate promotion of the brands and further recognition by the public.

The Food service legal entities (restaurants, hotels, shops) will have the ability to be voted by the users for their services and to gain recognition for their work.

The process is intuitive but contrary to traditional privacy controls, largely because it is clear and serves the users first.

In the future, Mories Organization expects to use AI devices and application to monitor the well-balanced diet for the user and to advice for consuming a specific nutrition plans. Users can be able to set their food preferences and get tips on useful ingredients, recipes and recommendations, weather they are vegan, keto diet followers or food lovers generally.

TOKEN


-TOKEN MODEL

The economic system that defines the use of a token forms the tokenomics of a platform. At its core, a Mories Token on BEP 20  node, SAGI token, is about defining a unit of measure for price signals in the marketplace.

TOKEN ECOSYSTEM
The Mories platform will target and cater to four different types of users, as described below:

 

–  Customers/Users – who form the core of the user base, collect and hold the majority of the data
in the system and both create and consume the utility of the network.

– Vendors- Parties selling goods and services to clients. (Restaurants, shops)

– Supply  Chain Participants- Agricultural Producers- People & businesses selling
goods and services to other companies.

– Data  Economy Participants- People who want to access/use data and information from
other users including advertisers, researchers, and nutrition health
professionals.

TOKEN DETAILS
The Mories Token (SAGI) is listed on Pancakeswap exchange and it’s currently paired with  BNB

Target amount offered 88,888,888

EXCHANGE LISTING STRATEGY
Until now, Mories Token has been funded by its founding team. In order to assure future growth and facilitate a successful launch, Mories Organization will engaged a respected international blockchain marketing and financial group to launch global campaigns and get listed in several exchanges. The intention is to raise sufficient awareness to take the platform to market.

The plan is to list on a top exchange to widely distribute tokens, obtain liquidity, drive awareness. We intend to also list on other exchanges following the initial exchange listing in order to be able to have global trading volume, which additionally catalyses exposure to new markets. We want to give our users and DApps developers the freedom to choose the Blockchain of their preference and to enable adoption of the assets on other chains. 

The additional 888,888,888 SAGI tokens will be launched to support the new projects on the ecosystem of Mories Organization on Binance smart chain. They will enable the use of smart applications for artificial intelligence and support the marketing of them.

Tokens are held in a BEP compatible cold wallet. The unlocking of tokens will be handled by the IBGA Foundation. The foundation utilizes multi-signature wallets that the CEO, Head of Finance, Trading Director, and Finance Controller have access to, of which three must be present to unlock funds.

Each user may request the transfer of its tokens to its wallet on BEP 20.

 

LAUNCH PROMOTION TOKEN BUDGET

Mories’s token supply consists of 88 milion tokens. We are utilizing 10% of that amount or 8,8 million SAGI tokens towards rapidly building a user base at launch. The tokens will be split 50/50 between Blockchain  and other embedded rewards and affiliate and influencer compensation for link shares that result in a successful registration.

Blockchain rewards 4,4 Million tokens will be embedded in Mories’s Blockchain  and other devices as rewards for users who are registered.

Affiliate and Influencer compensation The other 4,4 million tokens from the budget will be used to compensate affiliates and influencers whose direct link shares result in the paid registration of a Mories Blockchain. We have prepared for the very unlikely event that 100% of registrations will be attributed to affiliates and influencers. Any left over tokens from this will be sent back into the reserve for future marketing purposes. We have set up a link tracking affiliate accounting system which will monitor attribution as we move through launch marketing operations

 

RESERVE:

42% of the tokens will be held in the Mories Reserve and used to develop the project and community as follows:



– Operations reserve: 10% of tokens will be kept in an operating reserve that will act as the Mories treasury and will be deployed in a way that will most effectively scale the Mories ecosystem and ensure wide distribution of the SAGI token. We will release our treasury management plans following the public launch of the SAGI token.

 

 

Team & Advisors: 20% of the tokens will be released to founders and 20% early team members and advisers over a 3-year period to ensure that the founders and team stay aligned with the long term success of the project and that selling pressure is mitigated.

 

 

Token Launch: See above

 

 

Bounties/In-App rewards: 3% of the tokens will be given to community members who participate in bounties and who join the Mories ambassador program to grow the network in their region. We will be creating a granular bounty model that considers and rewards all positive behavior in the Mories ecosystem including hosting events, translating materials, sharing content, posting research, making bets, inviting friends, among others.

 

 

Marketing & Community development: 4% of the tokens will be reserved for marketing and community development efforts such as hosting tournaments, experiential marketing campaigns, and VIP experiences. This is an important marketing reserve to host campaigns that are large enough in scale with significant enough rewards to create viral events that onboard millions of users.

 

 

Network Growth 10% of the SAGI tokens are allocated towards but not limited to SAGI staking pools, Liquidity pools, new exchange listings, and initial liquidity for the new exchanges. Any SAGI tokens that are to be moved for network growth will require a community announcement prior to execution.Funding rounds 23% of tokens are allocated to funding rounds and possible partnerships. Large tranches will be required to participate to the same 3-year lock-in program which restricts the sale of tokens by founders and advisors.

USE OF PROCEEDS

The majority of the capital raised will go to developing, marketing, operating, administration and growing the Mories network and ecosystem as the value of the SAGI token will be directly tied to the growth of the Mories ecosystem.

 

TOKEN UTILITY

Mories Token (SAGI) is the token used for pricing goods, services, rewards, and trades within the system. We intend to use it, to create a more intuitive user experience than is the norm for blockchain-based applications. In particular, SAGI will be used to as value for transactions.

The improved user experience is intended to abstract away implementation complexity so users can focus on enjoying the application. A transaction fee will be subtracted from the value of each transaction. A portion of that transaction fee will accrue to Mories platform to support R&D and community development. A portion of the transaction fee will be burned, reducing the circulating supply of SAGI over time.

The current plan is based on:

1.5% transaction fee
25% of the transaction fee burned
75% of the transaction accrues to Mories Platform
Burn stops when 10% of the initial supply (8,8 million tokens) is destroyed
TARGET MARKET Our ability to create an interactive platform, develop a product and services marketplace as well as a food data marketplace depends on significant user engagement from a diverse user base.

To drive early platform adoption, Mories will focus its efforts on attracting two cohorts: (1) Tech comfortable with integrating technology into their everyday lives (2) Premium nutrition foodlovers, or those deeply passionate, who go the extra mile in caring for their daily nutrition diet and exercise (e.g. those who purchase food).

MARKET ASSESSMENT

 

The food industry for healthy products with high nutritional values is experiencing tremendous growth, with the technology sector attracting the most attention from investors. The global personalized nutrition market size has grown from USD 8.2 billion in 2020 to USD 16.4 billion by 2025, recording a CAGR of 15.0%

The increase in awareness pertaining to the benefits of consuming nutrients has encouraged consumers to opt for a more personalized approach. The growing awareness among consumers has led to an increase in acceptance of products with high nutritional value, which is projected to drive the demand for personalized nutrition. In addition, technological advancements and the rise in investments and collaborations by key players in the personalized nutrition market are factors that are projected to provide growth opportunities for key players. However, the high cost of nutrition programs and dietary supplements is a key factor that is projected to hinder the growth of the market. Many parties (vegans, organic food users, nutritionists, etc.) are demanding trustworthy food to be brought to the forefront. The industry is heading towards a more truthful and transparent future – one where customers are more aware, informed and invested in their healthy lifestyle.

Platform Economies

Most ground breaking digital products and services that come to the market today are based on platform business models. Mories Organization plans to bring this trend to the food industry, having seen similar interconnected platforms emerge in various industries. All the required technologies exist today, Mories Organization will apply existing technologies and create a platform to allow all users to communicate and trade both data and product.

COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT

To date, here is no platform focused on building something similar to Mories Organization. There are a handful of centralized and platform-based projects targeting specific needs in the food ecosystem, e.g. tracking records, food analysis, etc.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Mories Organization is building an ecosystem, the first truly multi-faceted protocol for food lovers. Rather than looking at niche-specific platforms as competitors, Mories considers them to be potential partners who will provide key insights to users on the platform. The Blockchain Food Lover Tag will put customers at the forefront of Mories’s ecosystem but we will encourage participants to connect additional IoT devices, to supplement data collection efforts.

FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE

As with any new market, the first entrant generally holds the advantage. Mories Organization  will leverage this favorable position by building tech, improving existing assets, and growing its already talented multi-disciplinary team to create a barrier preventing would-be competitors from entering the market with similar goals.

POTENTIAL PARTNERS

As noted Mories Organization does not seek to compete with tech and food health platforms in the space, but rather to become the key connective tissue within the space (something that is yet to emerge) and allow these various other companies to integrate directly with the Mories Organization platform. Mories Organization will target companies, tech, and services that are a good fit for the platform such as Food Centers, Nutritionists, Healthy Diet Advisers, Fitness Centers  and subscription services such as Mailchimp, but will keep the door open for new and existing entities looking to access the Mories Organization user base, and add to the depth of data collected on the platform.

A TECH TREND

Many exciting opportunities exist for Mories Organization both in food tech and connecting the currently fragmented food industry and its data. With proper timing and marketing Mories seeks to carve out a meaningful share of the ‘growing healthy food industry pie’.

According to Grand View Research, 69% of producers are likely to use technology to keep track of their foods. Mobile device apps, have raised $300 million in funding and continue to flood into the market to fill the demand. What is more impressive is that these applications continue to create new markets. The services industry will experience continued innovation as tracking healthy food products from the field to shelve.

ADDRESSABLE MARKET

Global Natural Food & Drinks Market was valued at $79,137 million in 2016, and is estimated to reach $191,973 million by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 13.7% from 2017 to 2023.

 Natural food & drinks are minimally processed and free of artificial sweeteners, colours, flavours and additives like hydrogenated oils, stabilizers and emulsifiers. But there is no certification or inspection system to ensure that the label is accurate. Nonetheless, this market possesses high growth potential, owing to the fact that several foodservice providers, such as restaurants & hotels are inclined towards providing healthy food & drinks to cater to the needs of health-conscious consumers.

 



 

Currently, consumer behaviour is more inclined towards the health & wellness, safety, social impact, and experience in their food purchasing decisions along with the traditional values such as convenience, price, and taste. Thus, increase in emphasis on health & wellness drives the growth of the global natural food & drinks market. Moreover, rise in awareness for healthy food ingredients is expected to deliver the substantial growth opportunity to industry players.

 



 

These adjustments bring Mories Organization’s addressable market down to a conservative size of still undiscovered healthy food producers eager to enter the new healthy food trends worldwide. Given a functional platform in year 3, Mories will encourage more customers to use and prefer products with high nutritional values. The niche of Nutritionists, Diet Advisers, Healthy Food Advisers, Athletes have created enormous need of use such products.

OPPORTUNITY SIZE AND REVENUE MODEL

The Mories team’s first priority is building out the platform itself. It would be a waste of resources to invest in attracting members to a platform that is yet to be built. The 4 proposed steps of the strategy are outlined below.

DEVELOPMENT

During development, the marketing team will focus entirely on brand awareness. Pre-app marketing efforts will be mainly guerrilla marketing and word of mouth, establishing Mories’s affinity to food tech and developing a trustworthy image in multiple niche food communities.

VENDOR ONBOARDING

Once the user base has reached a considerable size, the marketing team will pursue product and service providers. Early business adopters will benefit from being among the first to access our users and potentially claim new lifetime customers with their quality products.

USER ONBOARDING

Once the platform is built to an MVP level, the team will begin paid marketing to food producers in order to rapidly build an active user base and will utilize the existing partnership with Global Digital Assets to attract the blockchain community. During this initial phase, Mories will build the user base by offering food products with high nutritional values.

TECH FULFILLMENT

With a user base and an active business community in place, the development of the technological ecosystem will begin. Continued development and improvement to the platform, AI, and API will follow ensuring that user expectations are being not only met, but exceeded.

 

ROADMAP

The SAGI team has identified 7 key steps necessary to completing an MVP of the working platform. We do not want to set any concrete timelines yet, but given the event of successful funding we’re confident we can complete the steps laid out below within or around 48 months from the date of funding. The following steps will be done in tandem at many phases, a more detailed roadmap will be provided in future versions of the whitepaper.
